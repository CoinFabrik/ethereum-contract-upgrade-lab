Each folder here represents a different upgrade strategy.

The \_test-subjects folder contains example contracts for which the strategies will be applied.
Each test subject has a first version and a second version. Each upgrade strategy will
attempt to upgrade the test subjects from version 1 to version 2. The contracts will not
necessarily be exactly the same as the test subjects examples, but the functionality should
be equivalent.
